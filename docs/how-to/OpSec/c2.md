### Objective

Design and deploy **Command and Control (C2) infrastructure** that protects operator identity, masks traffic, and mimics real-world adversary TTPs. OPSEC-safe C2 setups reduce the risk of detection, blacklisting, and attribution during Red Team engagements.

---

### Prerequisites

- A defined scope and Rules of Engagement (RoE)
- Threat model or TTPs selected
- Infrastructure provisioning resources (cloud, VPS providers)
- Familiarity with one or more C2 frameworks (e.g., Cobalt Strike, Mythic, Sliver)

---

### Step-by-Step Instructions

---

#### 🧱 1. Architect a Multi-Tier C2 Infrastructure

Use a **staged C2 architecture** with at least:

- **Beacon/implant → Redirector** (traffic routing only)
- **Redirector → Backend C2 server** (handles logic, staging, post-ex)

This isolates detection and blocks direct connection to the operator’s C2 server.

**Example Layout:**
```
[Target] → [Redirector: nginx/CDN] → [Backend C2 Server: CS, Mythic]
```

---

#### 🕵️ 2. Provision Infrastructure with OPSEC in Mind

Use providers that allow alias registration or crypto payments.

- Providers: `Vultr`, `DigitalOcean`, `OVH`, `BuyVM`, `Shinjiru`, etc.
- Use **burner email addresses** and avoid personal billing info
- Register infrastructure under pseudonyms or temporary accounts

📌 *Tip:* Consider chaining through **VPN + TOR + clean VM** when provisioning.

---

#### 🌐 3. Set Up Redirectors Using NGINX or Apache

Redirectors forward only **specific implant traffic** to the backend.

- NGINX Example Config:
```nginx
location /update {
    proxy_pass https://backendc2[.]com;
    proxy_set_header Host backendc2.com;
}
```

- Tools: `Apache`, `NGINX`, `socat`, `HAProxy`, or Cobalt Strike’s `redirector.rb`

Use **TLS with valid certs** (Let’s Encrypt or custom) and domain fronting if desired.

---

#### 🪪 4. Register Domains and Set Up TLS

- Use **reputable-looking domains** (`cdn-update.net`, `support-gateway.com`)
- Register via Namecheap, Gandi, Njalla, or Epik
- Setup **Let’s Encrypt certs** or mimic common providers (e.g., GoDaddy, Cloudflare)

**Optional:**
- Use **Cloudflare** as a protective CDN or to simulate domain fronting
- Avoid newly registered domains unless simulating commodity threats

---

#### 🔁 5. Configure C2 Profile for Stealth

In your C2 (e.g., Cobalt Strike, Mythic):
- Set **User-Agent** to legit traffic (`Mozilla/5.0`, `Outlook/16.0`, etc.)
- Mimic headers used by real SaaS tools (e.g., Slack, O365, Zoom)
- Use long **sleep intervals** and jitter (e.g., `900s ±50%`)

Sample CS Profile Snippet:
```plaintext
set useragent "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)";
http-get {
    set uri "/update";
    client {
        header "Accept" "*/*";
        header "Host" "cdn-update.com";
    }
}
```

---

#### 🧪 6. Test Before Launching

- Run `whois`, `dig`, and `curl` to confirm resolution and proxy behavior
- Verify endpoint detection does not flag implant callbacks
- Use `Wireshark` to analyze packet structure and TLS negotiation

---

#### 🔥 7. Maintain OPSEC Throughout the Engagement

- Rotate domains and infrastructure on detection or compromise
- Avoid hosting multiple client ops from the same backend
- Re-image or destroy VPS and domains after the op ends

Keep logs *offline*, and separate operator actions by engagement.

---

### Summary

A hardened, well-segmented C2 infrastructure is your lifeline during a Red Team op. Treat its setup with the same rigor as payload development — because if your C2 burns, **so does your access, stealth, and credibility**.

Build it right, obfuscate it well, and rotate it like a pro.
