### What Is Exploitation?

**Exploitation** is the phase where a Red Team or attacker takes advantage of a validated vulnerability to gain access, execute code, escalate privileges, or move closer to the operational objective.

This is where theory becomes action â€” the moment a simulated adversary shifts from passive probing to active compromise.

In a Red Team context, exploitation is not just about popping shells â€” itâ€™s about doing so in a way that mimics real threat actor behavior while maintaining stealth, persistence, and alignment with the Rules of Engagement (RoE).

---

### Why Exploitation Matters

Exploitation is a high-leverage point in any operation. Itâ€™s how Red Teams:
- Convert recon and validation into initial access
- Establish footholds inside the network
- Bypass authentication or escalate privileges
- Demonstrate real-world business impact

Proper exploitation separates script-kiddie noise from skilled adversary simulation. Done well, it reveals weaknesses in both technical controls and human response mechanisms.

### Types of Exploits

| Exploit Type | Examples |
|--------------|----------|
| **Remote Code Execution (RCE)** | Exploiting a web app to drop a reverse shell |
| **Local Privilege Escalation (LPE)** | Abusing weak service permissions or SUID binaries |
| **Authentication Bypass** | JWT manipulation, default creds, insecure OAuth |
| **File Inclusion / Path Traversal** | Reading sensitive files or uploading payloads |
| **Deserialization / Memory Corruption** | Achieving execution via object or heap exploitation |

### Common Exploitation Methods

#### âš¡ Manual Exploitation
Direct interaction with the vulnerability using:
- Custom payloads
- Browser-based attacks
- Raw HTTP requests
- Command-line tools (`curl`, `nc`, `socat`, etc.)

#### ðŸ§° Exploit Frameworks
- **Metasploit** â€“ Popular and modular, but loud and often detected
- **Impacket** â€“ Ideal for SMB, Kerberos, RDP, and AD abuse
- **Cobalt Strike / Brute Ratel** â€“ C2 framework integration
- **Custom Python or Go payloads** â€“ For stealth and OPSEC control

#### ðŸ§¬ Living-off-the-Land (LotL)
Use of built-in OS tools:
- PowerShell, WMI, CertUtil (Windows)
- Bash, curl, systemd abuse (Linux)
- No third-party binaries = lower detection footprint

### OPSEC & Stealth Considerations

Exploitation is risky â€” especially if you're:
- Writing to disk
- Injecting into memory
- Triggering suspicious child processes
- Making outbound C2 connections

Minimize exposure by:
- Testing exploits in a **lab first**
- Using **in-memory payloads**
- Encoding or obfuscating traffic
- Matching user-agent and headers to legit apps
- Logging every action (what, when, how, from where)

ðŸ’¡ *Red Team Tip:* The best exploit is the one the Blue Team never sees.

### Example: From Exploit to Foothold

1. Validate that a file upload endpoint allows unrestricted `.aspx` file drops.
2. Craft a simple web shell or use `msfvenom` to generate an aspx reverse shell payload.
3. Upload and execute the payload.
4. Catch the connection with a staged listener (`netcat`, `Metasploit`, or C2).
5. Immediately enumerate, escalate, or drop persistence â€” based on RoE.

### Exploitation vs. Post-Exploitation

Exploitation = **Getting In**  
Post-Exploitation = **What You Do After You're In**

Exploitation should be:
- **Surgical**: Only target hosts that serve the objective.
- **Measured**: Avoid spraying payloads or triggering unnecessary detections.
- **Objective-driven**: Always tie the exploit back to the goal (e.g., "exfiltrate financial records", not "pop boxes for fun").

---

### Conclusion

Exploitation is where Red Team operations transition from opportunity to impact. Itâ€™s not just about owning a system â€” itâ€™s about doing so in a way that simulates real threat actor behavior, minimizes detection, and aligns with mission goals.

Whether you're dropping an implant, spawning a shell, or pivoting deeper â€” the key is intent, control, and stealth.
