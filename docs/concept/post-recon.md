# Post-Exploitation Reconnaissance

Post-exploitation reconnaissance refers to the set of activities a threat actor or red team operator performs **after gaining initial access to a target system or environment**, in order to **better understand the internal network**, **identify high-value assets**, and **plan next actions** such as **privilege escalation**, **lateral movement**, or **data exfiltration**.

It is not about how to do recon—that’s covered in _How-To_ docs—but about **why** post-ex recon matters and how it fits into the broader engagement lifecycle.

---

## 🧠 Why Is Post-Exploitation Recon Important?

Gaining initial access is **only the beginning**. Once inside, the operator lacks visibility. External recon tells you _about_ the surface. Post-exploitation recon tells you what’s _underneath_.

Key motivations:

- **Build situational awareness**: What is this machine? Where is it? What can it access?
- **Map the network**: Identify adjacent systems, subnets, domain structure.
- **Identify privilege paths**: Understand what credentials are cached, what services are running, what privileges are available.
- **Determine value**: Spot systems that contain valuable data or admin access—file servers, backups, DCs, etc.
- **Blend in**: Recon helps inform stealth—e.g., what processes or usernames are common to mimic?

## 🔍 What Happens During Post-Exploitation Recon?

Recon in this phase can include:

| Category                    | Common Actions |
|-----------------------------|----------------|
| **Host Identification**     | OS version, hostname, uptime, patches |
| **User Context**            | Whoami, groups, login sessions, token analysis |
| **Credential Discovery**    | Mimikatz, lsass dumps, vaults, browsers |
| **Network Mapping**         | ARP, route table, DNS cache, netstat |
| **Service Discovery**       | Listening ports, scheduled tasks, services |
| **Domain Enumeration**      | AD structure, GPOs, trusts, domain admins |
| **Application Context**     | Check for browsers, password managers, endpoints with EDR |

## 🧩 Where Does It Fit in the Kill Chain?

Post-ex recon often sits between these phases:

```
Initial Access → Execution → [ Post-Exploitation Recon ] → Privilege Escalation → Lateral Movement → Objective
```

It feeds directly into **escalation and pivoting**, and in mature environments, it’s also critical for **target prioritization** and **time-to-impact** optimization.

## ☢️ OPSEC Considerations

Operators must be mindful:

- Avoid noisy enumeration tools (`net user /domain`, `nslookup`, etc.) unless stealth is not a concern.
- Prefer native tools or proxy-aware modules to avoid triggering EDR/NDR.
- Cache results locally and **query once**, analyze offline.
- Understand which recon commands **touch the network**, query LDAP, or modify files.

## 🧭 Summary

> Post-exploitation reconnaissance is the bridge between **access** and **impact**. Without it, operators risk flailing in the dark. With it, every move can be **informed, deliberate, and strategic**.

By mastering post-ex recon, red teamers and threat actors can **maximize access** while **minimizing detection**—turning initial access into a full compromise.
