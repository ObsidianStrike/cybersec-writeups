### What Is Post-Exploitation?

**Post-Exploitation** is the phase of an offensive operation that begins *after* a system has been successfully compromised. It focuses on maintaining access, escalating privileges, exploring the environment, and advancing toward operational objectives â€” all while minimizing detection.

While exploitation gets you in the door, post-exploitation determines what you do once youâ€™re inside.

This is where tradecraft separates seasoned operators from opportunistic attackers.

---

### Why Post-Exploitation Matters

For Red Teams, post-exploitation is where impact is demonstrated and objectives are fulfilled. It helps:
- Assess **lateral movement paths** and domain trust relationships
- Identify and extract **sensitive data**
- Simulate **real-world attacker behavior**
- Test the effectiveness of **defensive monitoring and response**
- Provide **tangible evidence** of business risk

Without post-exploitation, access is just a data point â€” not a story.

### Key Objectives of Post-Exploitation

| Objective | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Privilege Escalation** | Gain SYSTEM/root or domain admin |
| **Persistence** | Establish a foothold that survives reboots or resets |
| **Credential Access** | Dump hashes, tokens, or cleartext creds |
| **Lateral Movement** | Move from one host to another (workstation â†’ server â†’ domain controller) |
| **Data Collection** | Identify and extract documents, emails, databases, configs |
| **Situational Awareness** | Map the environment, users, domain trust, defenses |

### Common Techniques

#### ðŸ”‘ Credential Dumping
- `mimikatz`, `lsass` memory scraping, SAM extraction
- Token impersonation, Kerberoasting, DCSync (Impacket `secretsdump.py`)

#### ðŸ§± Privilege Escalation
- SUID binaries (Linux), weak service permissions (Windows)
- UAC bypass, DLL hijacking, unquoted service paths
- Always look for `whoami` â‰  `who needs to be`

#### ðŸ§­ Lateral Movement
- `psexec`, `WMI`, `WinRM`, `RDP`, `SMB`
- Pivoting with SOCKS proxies (e.g., `socks_proxy`, Cobalt Strike beacon)

#### ðŸ“¥ Data Collection & Exfil
- Search for sensitive data: `*.xlsx`, `*.docx`, `*.pst`, `.kdbx`, `.env`
- Use exfil-safe methods (e.g., staged zips, DNS exfil, encoded HTTP posts)

#### ðŸ”„ Persistence
- Registry keys (`Run`, `Winlogon`, `Scheduled Tasks`)
- Service creation, WMI Event Consumers
- Userland persistence: malicious Office macros, login scripts, `rc.local` or crontabs

### OPSEC Considerations

This phase carries high risk of **Blue Team detection**:
- Avoid triggering AV/EDR via known tools or binary signatures
- Donâ€™t beacon aggressively from newly compromised systems
- Clean up after escalations or dropped payloads
- Use **in-memory execution**, **LotL** techniques, and custom tooling

ðŸ“Œ *Tip:* Never assume your actions go unnoticed â€” plan for **incident response simulation** as part of your engagement.

---

### Example Workflow: Internal Network Post-Ex

1. Dump credentials using `mimikatz` or `secretsdump.py`.
2. Reuse creds to authenticate to a server via SMB/WinRM.
3. Enumerate domain membership and share permissions.
4. Identify and escalate to DA via token theft or delegation abuse.
5. Search for and extract sensitive documents from a file server.
6. Deploy lightweight persistence on a user machine for reentry.
7. Egress data through an encrypted C2 channel.

### Red Team Mindset

In post-exploitation, youâ€™re not just a hacker â€” youâ€™re an **operator**. Every action should answer:
- *Does this bring me closer to the objective?*
- *Does this burn access or increase detection risk?*
- *Is there a stealthier or more effective way to achieve the same result?*

---

### Conclusion

Post-exploitation is the most valuable â€” and most sensitive â€” phase of an offensive engagement. Itâ€™s where Red Teams earn their credibility by demonstrating impact, persistence, and precision without breaking things or getting caught.

Itâ€™s not just about where you go â€” itâ€™s about how you got there, how quietly you moved, and what you left behind.
