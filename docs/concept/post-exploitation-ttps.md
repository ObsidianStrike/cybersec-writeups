### What Are Post-Exploitation TTPs?

**Post-Exploitation Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)** are the specific behaviors and tradecraft operators use *after* initial compromise to escalate privileges, persist, move laterally, and complete objectives — all while evading detection.

These TTPs are what distinguish a skilled Red Team from a basic pentest. They allow operators to emulate real-world threat actors with precision and realism, often drawing directly from observed APT and ransomware group behaviors.

---

### Why They Matter

Understanding and applying post-exploitation TTPs enables Red Teams to:
- Simulate **full-spectrum attacker behavior** beyond initial access
- Map activity to the **MITRE ATT&CK** framework for reporting and purple teaming
- Validate **defensive visibility and detection** capabilities
- Prioritize **stealth and persistence** over brute-force or noisy methods
- Showcase **business impact** through controlled, credible actions

### Core Post-Exploitation Tactics

Here are the major tactic categories Red Teams focus on post-compromise, mapped to MITRE ATT&CK where applicable:

#### 🔼 Privilege Escalation
> Gain elevated access to expand operational scope.
- `T1068` – Exploitation for Privilege Escalation
- `T1548.002` – Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism: Bypass UAC
- `T1574.002` – DLL Search Order Hijacking

#### 🔒 Credential Access
> Extract, reuse, or crack credentials to maintain or expand access.
- `T1003` – OS Credential Dumping (`mimikatz`, `lsass`, `secretsdump.py`)
- `T1555` – Credentials from Password Stores (e.g., browser vaults)
- `T1552.001` – Unprotected Credentials in Configuration Files

#### 🔁 Persistence
> Maintain a foothold that survives restarts or resets.
- `T1053.005` – Scheduled Task/Job: Scheduled Task (Windows)
- `T1547.001` – Registry Run Keys
- `T1055` – Process Injection for stealthy reentry

#### ↔️ Lateral Movement
> Move across hosts to reach valuable targets.
- `T1021.002` – SMB/Windows Admin Shares
- `T1075` – Pass-the-Hash
- `T1550.002` – Pass-the-Ticket (Kerberos TGTs)

#### 🧭 Discovery
> Understand internal infrastructure, trust boundaries, and layout.
- `T1087.002` – User Account Discovery (Active Directory)
- `T1016` – System Network Configuration Discovery
- `T1482` – Domain Trust Discovery

#### 📤 Collection & Exfiltration
> Extract sensitive data or simulate data theft.
- `T1114` – Email Collection
- `T1005` – Data from Local System
- `T1041` – Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (HTTPS, DNS)

#### 🫥 Defense Evasion
> Obfuscate activity and hide from security controls.
- `T1140` – Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information
- `T1027` – Obfuscated Files or Information
- `T1036` – Masquerading (renaming binaries, LOLBins)

### Operator Tradecraft Tips

- **Blend in** with the environment — use native binaries (`net`, `wmic`, `reg`) instead of dropping tools.
- **Maintain logs of every TTP used**, including timing, host, context, and objective.
- **Test TTPs in a lab first** to gauge EDR/AV response and OPSEC footprint.
- **Adapt TTPs mid-operation** — if detection rises, switch to stealthier alternatives (e.g., token theft instead of credential dumping).

💡 *Tip:* Many adversary simulations fail not from bad exploits, but from poorly selected or noisy TTPs. Tailor your technique set to the target’s security maturity.

---

### Reporting & Mapping

During and after the engagement, map each TTP to:
- **MITRE ATT&CK IDs**
- **Targeted system(s)**
- **Success/failure status**
- **Visibility/detection (if known)**

This improves debriefs, detection tuning, and executive-level reporting. Tools like `AttackFlow`, `Security Onion`, or `Vectr.io` can assist in this mapping.

---

### Conclusion

Post-exploitation TTPs are the lifeblood of realistic, impactful Red Team operations. They allow you to behave like real threat actors — staying low, moving deep, and delivering evidence of what a true compromise could look like.

Mastering these TTPs doesn’t just make you a better operator — it makes your adversary emulation credible, valuable, and dangerous (in the best way).
