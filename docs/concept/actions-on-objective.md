# 🎯 Actions on Objectives

After initial access, privilege escalation, and lateral movement, an adversary transitions to their **true goal**—called **Actions on Objectives**.

This phase reflects the **"why"** behind an operation. It’s when an attacker acts on the intended **mission objectives**, which vary based on motivation, funding, and opportunity.
